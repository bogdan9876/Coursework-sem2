Usage
To make requests in Postman, you can copy the JSON collection, and create a new Postman collection using this code. Here's how to do it:
Open Postman and click on the "Import" button in the upper left corner.
In the "Import" window, select the "Raw Text" tab.
Paste the JSON code you copied into the "Raw Text" field.
Click on the "Import" button in the lower right corner.
After a successful import, you will see the new collection listed to the left of the Postman menu.
Expand the collection and select the desired query (for example, "Create Department").
Click the "Send" button to complete the request and receive a response.
The results of the request will be displayed in the "Response" tab.
You can repeat these steps for each request if you want to do them sequentially.
